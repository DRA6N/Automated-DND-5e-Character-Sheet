# Automated DnD 5th Edition Character Sheet
![](https://www.webpagescreenshot.info/image-url/BVI-AR5ny)

I found an Excel Character Sheet for DnD 5th edition and thought it would be nice to have some automated features built in, to aid with the character creation process. 

## Features
Some of the features include:
- Auto-checking Skills based on Backgrounds
- Auto-checking Skills based on Class
- Auto-fill information for Race and Class-specific Proficiencies, Feats and Traits. 
- Allows selection of skills when choosing a Class that gives you an option which skill you'd like to take.
- Ability Score Roller - 4d6 drop, 3d6, 3d6+6 
- Auto-generates a Spells sheet if a spellcaster Class is selected
- Custom colored character sheets
... and so much more!

------------


### Instructions
- Select your Race,Class, Alignment and Background first. The Character sheet will auto-populate the rest of the sheet, as well as adjust for ability modifiers, HD, skills, etc. (Be sure to check the other tabs too).

- If you select a Spellcaster class, a Spells sheet will appear below.

**DO NOT modify any Hidden sheets!**

------------


This is an ongoing project and I plan to add more features to this Character Sheet. Keep your eyes peeled for new versoins.
